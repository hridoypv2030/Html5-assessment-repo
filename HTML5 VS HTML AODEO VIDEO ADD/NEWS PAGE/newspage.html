            Cox's Bazar sea beach which is the longest sea beach in the world. The beach in Cox's Bazar is an unbroken 125 km sandy sea beach with a gentle slope. It is located 150 km south of the industrial port Chittagong.</p>

            <h4>To be brutally honest, this “beach</h4>
            <p>To be brutally honest, this “beach” is not even a beach in the sense that any Westerner would understand. It’s basically a wide sediment plain that the sea laps over as the tide comes in. The “sand” again is a kind of sediment that resembles wet cement. As this is a sediment plain and not a beach, there are no attractive coconut trees, no vegetation of any kind, no seashells… it’s a wide, very wide sediment plain of wet cement. “Longest beach in the world”—what is that supposed to even signify? Does anyone even care how many kilometers a beach runs? Beach length doesn’t mean anything. What matters is the quality of the sand and water, the attractiveness, the swim-ability and wave characteristics, etc. Cox Bazaar beach fails on every one of these, except that there are waves, but unfortunately no beach but a sediment plain to land on. The only positive thing to say is that the wet cement-like plain is diligently kept clean, and since there are no seashells or even stones you can very safely walk barefoot on it—but no one seems to walk barefoot, curiously no one removes their footwear or any articles of clothing. The water too is clean but dark and murky due to the color of the sediment. So what is it if not a beach—it’s a kind of gathering spot for the Bangladeshi public—a wide expanse to appear in your finery and frolic among the masses. It’s a place to see and be seen and get photographed with SLR cameras.
